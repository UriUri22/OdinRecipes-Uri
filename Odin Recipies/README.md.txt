This is a project from the ODIN Training course meant to teach about HTML and CSS formatting. 
Remembber to upload this to GITHUB for proper tutorial statuses. 

After completing the project I learned how cool git can actually be to upload and see the changes I make to the code printed in a way that's easy for me to access and I am in love with the service.
I went ahead a little bit of a personal touch to the assisgnbment that makes it stands out but its nothing more than a link her or a picture here I can't wait to style it.
