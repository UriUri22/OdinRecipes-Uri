                    <li>2/3 cup water</li>
                    <li>'Furikake' a japanese seasoning used for rice balls</li>
                        <p>-This isn't completely neccessary but it is included in the recipe.</p>
                    <li>3 sheets of 'nori' also known as dry seeweed (1-inch strips preffered)</li>
                    <li>Salt (to your preference)</li>
                    <li>'shiso with hijiki' also known as dried seaweed flakes (as many as you prefer)</li>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <p>Finally lets get cooking, see the steps below to learn how to make these lovely snacks.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Cook your rice to a soft texture like sushi rice,  a rice cooker is reccommended for the best results.</li>
                    <li>Pop your cooked rice into a nice mixing bowl. Add the furikake or rice flavouring and mix through evenly. Separate the rice into equal portions, big enough to be a large handful each.
                    </li>
                    <li>Wet your hands with water and rub together with a pinch or two of salt. This stops the rice sticking to your hands and helps keep it fresher for longer.
                    </li>
                    <li>Take up one portion of rice in your hands.
                    </li>
                    <li>If you are hiding some fillings inside, here is where you make an indent, place the ingredients inside and fold the rice over, then lightly press into a ball.
                    </li>'
                    <li>Using mainly your fingertips while resting the rice on your palm, start to press and squeeze the rice into a triangular shape, rotating as you go so itâ€™s even.
                    </li>
                    <li>Place a slice of nori on the bottom of the onigiri (the rough side should face the rice) and fold it up towards to the middle of the onigiri.
                    </li>
                </ol>
